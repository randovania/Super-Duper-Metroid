# Super-Duper-Metroid
Super Duper Metroid is a Super Metroid patcher and interface program, intended for use with randomizer programs. SDM is a **work in progress**, and is likely very broken in its current state. SDM requires an installation of Python 3 to work, although I haven't done any testing to determine which versions precisely work, and requires a Headerless ROM file to modify. Remember that video game piracy is a crime - only use legally obtained copies of the game Super Metroid with this program. Has been tested for NTSC.

# Building
Requires an adequate version of python  
Steps:  
1. Clone this repository
2. Open a terminal in the repository's root
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment with `call venv/bin/activate` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on Unix-based systems
5. Install requirements by running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Install as editable by running `python -m pip install -e .`
  
You can now run scripts from the project from terminal, using the virtual environment. Or run `python -m Super-Duper-Metroid` to patch the game via a CLI interface.

# Credit
Credit goes to Samuel Roy for writing most of this code.  
Kazuto wrote the More Efficient Item PLMs Hack, which is recreated in parts of this code.  
Metroid Construction and Kejardon provided a lot of documentation which I made use of.  
PHOSPHOTiDYL wrote the Skip Intro Saves hack, which is included in this program.  
Smiley and Flo wrote the Cheap Charge IPS patch.  
[n00btube](https://github.com/n00btube) wrote the Save Refill patch.  
Total, Fusda, and Leodox were responsible for most of the other IPS patches.
